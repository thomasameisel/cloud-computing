Cloud Computing - HW01 Outline

Client#01		Sends a request to the server to check if a number is prime or not.
		After a certain time, send the request again. Continue sending requests until 			client is terminated.

Client#02		Start an initial virtual machine to handle requests sent to the server.
		Invokes look busy on the initial virtual machine so that it seems overloaded and 			response time is diminished.
		Check response times; if response time is higher than a certain threshold, allocate 		another virtual machine to handle the requests; do this as needed.
		Allocate tasks to the vm(s) using (a) a round robin method or (b) priority.
		After a certain time period, remove look busy from the initial virtual machine.

Web Server	Grabs requests from Client#01 and sends them to the virtual machine(s) allocated. 			Passes results back from the vm(s) to client.

Virtual Machine(s)	Receive request from the server to perform a prime check, and send the results back to 		the server to be passed along to the client.
